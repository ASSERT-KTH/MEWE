  binary:    qrcode_multivariant_instrumented_str.wasm

Functions:         4239
  Imported:          22
  Non-imported:    4217
  Exported:           4

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:        320
  Of those, unique functions:   320 (i.e., at least 7.55% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    578609
  call:           14129 (2.44% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:    175 (0.03% of all instructions, 1.22% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     2819 × global.get   4083 × global.set   6902 total (41/59% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:   2819 (66.85% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
