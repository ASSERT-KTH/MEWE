Functions:         4065
  Imported:          22
  Non-imported:    4043
  Exported:           3

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:        310
  Of those, unique functions:   310 (i.e., at least 7.63% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    563928
  call:           10923 (1.94% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:    176 (0.03% of all instructions, 1.59% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     2720 × global.get   3920 × global.set   6640 total (41/59% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:   2720 (67.28% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
